# Walter's Project System

One system for every project you run with AI. It gets smarter each time.

## The files

Four Markdown files sit in your project root:

- **CLAUDE.md** — the map: what the system is, which file holds what, the order to read them. Named exactly `CLAUDE.md` so your AI tool auto-loads it every session. You never edit it.
- **rules.md** — *Global*: the rules you work by, shared by every project. *From this project*: lessons born here that might generalize. Only `/end` adds to it.
- **state.md** — the live handoff, the one file that changes every session. Sections: **Now**, **Short term**, **Long term**, **Rules & lessons**, and **Continue**.
- **`<project-name>.md`** — the project's context: what it is, why it exists, the shared vocabulary. Written once before you start — or built for you by `/adopt`.

## The skills

Invoked by hand — you call them, the model doesn't reach for them on its own:

- **/adopt** — bring a project you've *already started* into the system. Reads what's already there, then builds the four files above, grilling you until the context is complete.
- **/start** — begin a new project, or resume a session. Reads the files above, then interviews you until you both know what you're building and why.
- **/end** — close a session. Rewrites `state.md`, promotes any generalizable lesson into `rules.md`, then commits and pushes if the project has a git remote.
- **/handoff-continue** — running out of context mid-task: write what a fresh chat needs into `state.md`'s Continue section.
- **/continue** — in the fresh chat: read the Continue handoff and pick the work up.

`/adopt`, `/start` and `/continue` lean on **/grill** to interview you.

## The loop

1. **/adopt** a project already underway, or **/start** a new one — get grilled until you're aligned.
2. Build in vertical slices. Each change ships something that works.
3. **/end** — save state, capture the lesson, commit.
4. Next session, **/start** reads `state.md` and picks up where you left off.

Run out of context mid-task? `/handoff-continue` in the dying chat, `/continue` in a fresh one — same work, new context.

## Set it up

Keep the templates in a `project-system docs/` folder inside the folder you open with your AI tool, and give each project its own folder next to it:

```
your-workspace/
├── project-system docs/     ← CLAUDE.md, rules.md, state.md (the templates)
├── project-a/
├── project-b/
└── ...
```

Then:

- **New project** — copy `CLAUDE.md`, `rules.md`, `state.md` into its folder, add a `<project-name>.md`, and run `/start`.
- **Project already underway** — run `/adopt` from inside it. It finds `project-system docs/`, copies the templates, and builds the context and state from what's already there.

Put the `skills/` folder wherever your AI tool loads skills from — they're global, installed once, and work on every project.

In this repo the templates live under `project-system docs/` to keep the root clean — but every reference inside them is a bare, root-relative name (`CLAUDE.md`, `rules.md`, `state.md`). That's on purpose: when they land in a real project's root, the links just work.
